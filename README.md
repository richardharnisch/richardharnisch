Hi there! 👋 I’m Richard, a final-year Bachelor’s student at the University of Groningen studying Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on Machine Learning & Data Science. Here I'm also a Teaching Assistant for [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://ocasys.rug.nl/current/catalog/course/WBAI056-05).

### What I’m working on
- [Time-series electricity price prediction](https://github.com/kodeInInk/PriceForecasting-GasuniexRUG) for the Dutch energy provider [Gasunie](gasunie.nl)
- Bachelor’s thesis on the existence of Double Descent in Reinforcement Learning
- Computer vision for textile defect detection at the German startup [descript.de](descript.de), in collaboration with TU Dresden

You’ll find these projects here once they’re ready for the world.

### What lives on this GitHub
This profile is a mix of:
- Course notes & coursework (shared where plagiarism rules allow), both group and individual. Unfortunately, most of these are private because they contain my submissions.
- Personal passion projects
- Quick-and-dirty scripts that took me 10x longer to make than just manually doing the task 🙃

I also love programming puzzles with a good narrative, especially Advent of Code. You can find my solutions (in Python) [here](https://github.com/richardharnisch/advent-of-code) complete with my solution management script.

### How to reach me

Thanks for stopping by 🤠
