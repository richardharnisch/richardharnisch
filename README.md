Hi there! 👋 I’m Richard, a final-year Bachelor’s student at the University of Groningen studying 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on Machine Learning & Data Science. Here I'm also a Teaching Assistant for [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://ocasys.rug.nl/current/catalog/course/WBAI056-05).

### 🔬 What I’m working on
- ⚡ **Time-series electricity price prediction** for the Dutch energy provider [Gasunie](gasunie.nl)
- 🎓 **Bachelor’s thesis** on the existence of Double Descent in Reinforcement Learning
- 👕 **Computer vision for textile defect detection** at the German startup [descript.de](descript.de), in collaboration with TU Dresden

You’ll find these projects (and many experimental side quests) here once they’re ready for the world.

### 🗂️ What lives on this GitHub
This profile is a mix of:
- 📓 **Course notes & coursework** (shared where plagiarism rules allow), both group and individual
- 🛠️ **Personal passion projects**
- ⚡ **Quick-and-dirty scripts** that took me 10x longer to make than just manually doing the task

### 🧩 For fun
I love programming puzzles with a good narrative, especially Advent of Code.

🎄 You can find my solutions (in Python) [here](https://github.com/richardharnisch/advent-of-code) complete with my solution management script.
