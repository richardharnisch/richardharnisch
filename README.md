I’m a final-year Bachelor’s student at the University of Groningen studying Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on Machine Learning & Data Science. Here I'm also a Teaching Assistant for [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://ocasys.rug.nl/current/catalog/course/WBAI056-05). Here's my [CV](https://files.catbox.moe/np3q6b.pdf) as of 2025-12. Currently working on:

- [Time-series electricity price prediction](https://github.com/kodeInInk/PriceForecasting-GasuniexRUG) for the Dutch energy provider [Gasunie](gasunie.nl)
- Bachelor’s thesis on the existence of Double Descent in Reinforcement Learning
- Computer vision for textile defect detection at the German startup [descript.de](descript.de), in collaboration with TU Dresden

Other than that, you'll find here:
- Course notes & coursework (shared where plagiarism rules allow), both group and individual. Unfortunately, most of these are private because they contain my submissions.
- Personal passion projects
- Quick-and-dirty scripts that took me 10x longer to make than just manually doing the task 🙃

I love programming puzzles with a good narrative, like Advent of Code. You can find my solutions (in Python) [here](https://github.com/richardharnisch/advent-of-code) (with my solution management script).
